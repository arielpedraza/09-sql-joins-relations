# Code 301 Lab 08 sql intro and postgres

**Andrew Bloom, Joe Waine**
**Version 1.0.7**

## Overview
1. We forked the lab 08 repo for this lab into Andrew's GitHub account. Andrew created a new branch and we started out with Joe navigating and Andrew driving. When we switched roles during pair programming, Joe fetched the working branch and pulled down the changes.
2. We first reviewed the User Stories and then reviewed the code in order to understand the structure and flow. This was pretty much the entirety of the lab. Next we worked on going through each of the comment sections and completing the commenting as necessary.
3. Last we worked on updating the README and completing any remaining tasks.

## Getting Started
To get started using this project, clone the repo down to your computer, and initialize node and install all of the dependencies.
