# Code 301 Lab 09 sql joins relations

**Andrew Bloom, Ariel Pedraza**
**Version 1.0.7**

## Overview
1. We forked the lab 08 repo for this lab into Ariel's GitHub account. Ariel created a new branch and we started out with Andrew navigating and Ariel driving. When we switched roles during pair programming, Andrew fetched the working branch and pulled down the changes.
2. We first reviewed the User Stories and then reviewed the code in order to understand the structure and flow. Throughout the project we referenced the SQL cheat sheet located in the home repo. We started by working through the todo's in server.js, keeping article.js open split-right for comparison. After working through each of the todo's and reviews, we ran the tests required; they all passed.
3. Last we worked on updating the README and completing any remaining tasks.

## Getting Started
